=====================================
Create SO on Picking List
=====================================

This module is an add-on to ``stock``.

This module allows to create a Picking List, transfer items to a customer and create a Sales Order afterwards.
A menu in the Stock dashboard will show the picking lists for which an SO needs to be created and a filter is also available.
The created Sales Order will not generate Picking List when it's confirmed, it will use the origin one.

This module has been developped by Valentin THIRION @ AbAKUS it-solutions
