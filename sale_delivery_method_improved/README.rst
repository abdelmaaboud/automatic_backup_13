   Sale Delivery Method Improved
=====================================

This module is an add-on to ``sale``.

This module adds some improvements to the sale orders related to the delivery method applied:

* Does not add a delivery method line in the SO when one is selected
* It renames the button "Set Price" by "Add delivery costs"
* It only adds a delivery line to the quotation when clicking on the "Add delivery costs" button
* It adds to the invoice the field "delivery method" from the Sales Order
* It adds to the invoice report the "delivery method"
* If "Dropshipping" is selected, it selects the route in the lines
