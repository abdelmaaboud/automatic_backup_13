Purchase Order Improvements
===========================

This module is an ad-don to ``purchase``.

This module : 
   - adds the supplier reference on the purchase.order list view
   - raise a warning when a user doesn't select an analytic account on atleast one order line (on creation and edition)
   - modify the filter 'Reference' on search view : it doesn't search only on the name(reference) of the P.O. but on the supplier reference too
