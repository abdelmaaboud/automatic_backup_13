=========================================
Invoice factoring
=========================================

This module is a custom add-on to ``invoice``.


This module will add a checkbox ``do factoring`` on ``res.partner`` in the Sale group of the Accounting tab in the partner form.
It will also add the same checkbox auto-set from the partner on the ``account.invoice``.
When this field is checked, it will change the layout of the Invoice Report to show a specific message.

This message will me set on the ``res.company`` form.
