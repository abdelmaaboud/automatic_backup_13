Worklog management improvements
==========================================

This module is an  add-on to ``hr_timesheet``.

- It removes the short pop-up in the calendar view of the timesheet lines
- date_begin is a new datetime field used to order the worklogs in the calendar. This field is created because the date field from the worklog is a standard date type and we need hours and minutes.
- It changes the security rule for multi-company (Analytic Line, Timesheet allowed in read)
- It will add a header on the worklog form with the task stages
