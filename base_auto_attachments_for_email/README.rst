Attachments for Company auto sent for specific emails
========================================================

This modules adds list of possible attachments on a company for different languages. Each attachment can be linked to a mail template and when one of this email is sent, the attachments specified are auto added in the receiver's language.

To be flexible, this module also adds a checkbox (default=True) on each partner which is a company and sends the documents only if this checkbox is still checked.
