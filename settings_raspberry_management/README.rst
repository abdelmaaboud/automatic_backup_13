   Raspberry PIs management
=====================================

Eupen Control Room Raspberry PIs manager.

We define a model for PI device and some info can be set on it.

Individual PIs settings are created and accessed through a menu entry in Settings > Technical > Raspberry PI.

The PIs connect to Odoo and get the info they need (mainly the web page they have to load).

Installation notes
